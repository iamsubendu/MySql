MyISAM was the default storage engine for the MySQL relational database 
management system 

MyISAM provides table-level locking. 
(MySQL uses table-level locking for MyISAM , MEMORY , and MERGE tables, 
permitting only one session to update those tables at a time. 
This locking level makes these storage engines more suitable for 
read-only, read-mostly, or single-user applications.)

It is used mostly in Web and data warehousing. 
(Warehousing :- is a system used for reporting and data analysis, 
and is considered a core component of business intelligence)
Memory storage engine creates tables in memory. 
It is the fastest engine.

change tables from myisam to innodb without losing any data 
in the tables.
