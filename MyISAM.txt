MyISAM is based on the older (and no longer available) ISAM storage engine 
but has many useful extensions.

Each MyISAM table is stored on disk in two files. 
The files have names that begin with the table name and have an 
extension to indicate the file type. 
The data file has an .MYD (MYData) extension. 
The index file has an .MYI (MYIndex) extension. 
The table definition is stored in the MySQL data dictionary.

To specify explicitly that you want a MyISAM table, 
indicate that with an ENGINE table option:


CREATE TABLE t (i INT) ENGINE = MYISAM;
