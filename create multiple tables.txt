You can create several tables and views and grant privileges in one 
operation using the CREATE SCHEMA statement. The CREATE SCHEMA statement 
is useful if you want to guarantee the creation of several tables, views, 
and grants in one operation. If an individual table, view or grant fails, 
the entire statement is rolled back. None of the objects are created, 
nor are the privileges granted.

the CREATE SCHEMA statement can include only CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, 
and GRANT statements.

In the oracle database, the schema can be used to represent a part of the database.

The following statement creates two tables and a view that joins data 
from the two tables:

CREATE SCHEMA dbName
    CREATE TABLE dept (
        deptno NUMBER(3,0) PRIMARY KEY,
        dname VARCHAR2(15),
        loc VARCHAR2(25))
    CREATE TABLE emp (
        empno NUMBER(5,0) PRIMARY KEY,
        ename VARCHAR2(15) NOT NULL,
        job VARCHAR2(10),
        mgr NUMBER(5,0),
        hiredate DATE DEFAULT (sysdate),
        sal NUMBER(7,2),
        comm NUMBER(7,2),
        deptno NUMBER(3,0) NOT NULL
        CONSTRAINT dept_fkey REFERENCES dept)
   CREATE VIEW sales_staff AS
        SELECT empno, ename, sal, comm
        FROM emp
        WHERE deptno = 30
        WITH CHECK OPTION CONSTRAINT sales_staff_cnst
        GRANT SELECT ON sales_staff TO human_resources;
